### Draft
READ.me will be revised and finalized when I finish the course module.

This project is a node API made without using the Express framework.

Using the own node modules and simple js logics, it was created a http server,
with a routing system that respect the REST best practices

The project was done in first module of (JStack)[LINK DO CURSO] course, "First steps in Node.js",

What I learned from this module
- how to work with modules
- how to create http server
- the logic behind routing system
- how is get the query params in url
- how is get the path params in url and pass to route
